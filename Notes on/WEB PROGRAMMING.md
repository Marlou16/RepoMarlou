## Information on the Web Programming folder ##

My Web Programming folder contains the files created during the Udacity Coruses:

	*Intro to HTML and CSS*
	*JavaScript Basics*

The global idea that I'm going to create an (interactive) online résumé. :)

### ----- Remarks on the Basics ----- ###
/* A Conceptional Understanding of websites (comparing it with your house) is as follows:
		-> _HTML_ files form the structure of your house ('walls')
		-> _CSS_ marks the style of your house ('what color are the walls')
		-> _JavaScript_ give the interactive components in your house ('garage remote')
* To get the HTML-code of a page, press `Ctrl+Shift+I`
* _HTML_ = HyperText Markup Language, the standard markup language used to create web pages.
* _CSS_ = Cascading Style Sheets, style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language.
* _DOM_ = Document Object Model, a cross-platform and language-independent convention for representing and interacting with objects in HTML (and other markup languages). The nodes of every document are organized in a tree structure, called the DOM tree.


### ----- Remarks on HTML ----- ###
/* HTML elements are _always_ rectangular :)
